# Python extension module

This is an **experimental** module with an example of integration between NDK DSL and python(graalvm implementation).

In general the integration works, but some libraries are not properly supported right now(see https://github.com/oracle/graalpython/issues/269).

You need to download graalvm instead of your usual JDK to test this module and choose it as SDK for the project.
